  - print some washers to tighten the loose handle fit
  - drill out the 2 holes in each handle with 7/32" drill bit for the magnet feet

# Battery?
We ended up using the [Atom Tech 0.3"](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07JZCZSH9/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o02_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1) thin battery (you have only 0.5" clearence on the back), and zip-tying the battery to the frame.  Works great.  Thin enough so we can still use the magnetic feet to stick the display to a metal fridge or filecabinet.
